LED lights Testing

This is a Python project to test the LED lights on a grid board and determine how many of them are on and off.

The code checks the existance of the file, checks the errors and ignores any commands which are not on, off or switch.
For the areas outside the gird still executed but only for the region of lights inside the boundary of the grid.

Samplemod structure is used for the project.
Github and Eclipse used as a remote repository.
